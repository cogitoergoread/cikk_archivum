Meanwhile, census data shows nearly one in two Americans, or 150 million people, have fallen into poverty or could be classified as low-income. Thirty-eight percent of African-American children and 35 percent of Latino children live in poverty.

But in a way, the evolution of our economy, more generally, began about 1980. That’s—if I would say, where’s there a dividing point—where the CEOs began to realize that they could take a larger and larger share of the corporate income. They understood that we have deficient corporate governance laws. And so, we didn’t require a say in pay. We didn’t require—you know, shareholders are supposed to own the firms, but the shareholders had no say in the pay of the companies—of the managers of the companies that they were supposed to own. A very strange situation. I mean, if you have somebody working for you, you would say you ought to have some say in their pay. And the result of that is they took a larger and larger share. And if you look at those at the top—as I say, they’re not the Watson and Cricks, the people who made these big changes—they’re corporate CEOs.

The concern about Bain Capital are twofold. One is that much of what they were doing was financial restructuring, which meant not creating jobs, taking money out of companies, putting them in a very fragile situation in which, a few years later, they go over the cliff, and jobs get destroyed. So, it is important to restructure firms to make them sustainable, efficient. But that wasn’t what a lot of the enterprises that they were engaged in doing.

The second problem, and I think most people find very disturbing, is that we have a tax law that says that those who are engaged working for this kind of restructuring—an important activity if it’s done well and done in a way that creates more productivity, more jobs—why should those people pay so little taxes? And that—you know, going back to the upper 1 percent, their average tax rate is about 15 percent. We tax speculators at a lower rate than we tax people who work for a living. It makes no sense.

I have some sympathy and say, let’s not make this personal. Let’s try to keep this at the basic level of principles. And, you know, the basic level of principles are relatively simple: people should be paying their share of the taxes. And paying share of taxes mean you don’t pay half the rate of other people who are working for a living. It means you don’t use offshore centers to escape taxes. You know, why is so much banking going on in the Cayman Islands? It’s not that the weather there is really particularly suited for moving electrons and running banks. You know, it’s there for one reason only: to escape regulation, to escape taxation, to undermine the basic principles of our economy. And it’s wrong for somebody who is trying to run for the president, who should be symbolizing, you know, making their fair share, to be using offshore accounts to avoid taxes and to avoid regulation.

The other point is, businesses are supposed to be creating value, creating jobs in America, and new American business. Now, this is where we have a tax system that’s distorted. But when you’re running for the president, you should be out there and saying we don’t want a distorted tax system that encourages jobs to move abroad, that encourages speculation over real wealth creation. If he had come out and said, like Warren Buffett, that it’s wrong for him—that Warren Buffett to have a lower tax rate than his secretary—if he came out and said it’s wrong to have a tax structure that encourages jobs to move abroad, you know, then I might have a little bit more sympathy. But so far, I haven’t heard that.
