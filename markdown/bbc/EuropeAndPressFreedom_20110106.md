Welcome to 2011. The year begins with a question. Is Hungary fit to assume [the rotating presidency of the European Union?](http://www.eu2011.hu/)

It may appear an arcane concern. The presidency is a less influential role than it used to be. Few voters understand its purpose beyond giving every country a six-month turn to be the face of the EU.

And then there is the muddle over Europe’s string of presidents. (There is a President of the European Parliament, a President of the Council, a President of the Commission.)

Perhaps because of their number these presidents compete for attention. It is one of the certainties of covering Europe that when there is a significant international event my e-mail will ping into life as the various presidents vie with each other for attention.

Now for these officials Hungary poses a dilemma. Its leader is Viktor Orban, a populist politician who was once a fierce anti-communist. Last year he surfed to power on a wave of distaste for the self-confessed lies of the Socialist government and their mismanagement of the economy.

Mr Orban’s party Fidesz controls a two-thirds majority in parliament. What this prime minister wants he gets.

His government has [just passed a new media law ](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12106860)which empowers a watchdog council to impose fines on coverage it considers “unbalanced” or offensive to “human dignity”. This council has five members and is dominated by government supporters.

Journalists can be forced to identify their sources when they write stories about national security or public safety. The right to secrecy will only be upheld if it is in the public interest. There will be limits on “crime-related news”. The fines can be close to a million dollars and have to be paid up-front before an appeal process can begin.

There is much that is vague and undefined about this legislation, but some of Hungary’s papers have responded by publishing blank pages. One left-leaning paper this week declared on its front page that “freedom of the press in Hungary comes to an end”.

Others, like [the International Press Institute](http://www.freemedia.at/site-services/singleview-master/5213/), warned that the new law is an attempt to “exert control over public broadcasters”.

A prominent liberal MEP, Guy Verhofstadt, says “the time of Pravda is over - this new law is unacceptable. Hungary must explain and the [\[]{}EU[\]]{} Commission must act.”

The Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, Jean Asselborn, questioned whether Hungary was fit to take on the EU presidency.

And most importantly, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman said that “as a country that is about to take over the EU presidency, Hungary will have a special responsibility for the whole union’s image in the world”.

In the face of such criticism Mr Orban says he doesn’t have wobbly knees. The law, his government insists, is to ensure balanced reporting. Budapest has hit back at the criticism. It says it “remains committed to freedom of the press and in no way wishes to stifle the opposition’s views”.

The EU - in a letter - has asked for clarification. But it has all come rather late. This week the EU caravan heads for Budapest to celebrate the start of the Hungarian EU presidency.

So here is the rub. What will the EU’s various presidents, commissioners and High Representative say? How will they respond to the Luxembourg question - is Hungary fit to lead the EU? Or the implied German question - are these the values that the EU wants to present to the world?

There is another sore point. Hungary is targeting new taxes at foreign companies. [Some](http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110103-706216.html) are threatening to pull out. Others say that it is illegal to go after foreign investors in a single market.

In the end the tax issue is about rules and markets. Media freedom is more difficult to judge. But Hungary is in the spotlight and the awkward questions won’t go away.

Is Hungary fit to assume the rotating presidency of the European Union?
=======================================================================

Its leader is Viktor Orban who last year was elected on a wave of distaste for the self-confessed lies of the Socialist government and their mismanagement of the economy. Well, this seems like a good start to me.

Orban’s Government just passed a new media law which empowers a watchdog council to impose fines if it considers reports “unbalanced” or offensive to “human dignity”. Also, this seems good to me.

Journalists can be forced to identify their sources when they write stories about national security or public safety. Good, personally I am just about fed up with unidentified sources and “a spokesperson said”, which predominate the western media and allow all kinds of babble to pass as news.

Others, like the International Press Institute, warned that the new law is an attempt to “exert control over public broadcasters”. So? This may or may not be a bad thing, especially if sources are not verified, if sources can routinely lie, or support some corporate agenda.

Most importantly, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman said that “as a country that is about to take over the EU presidency, Hungary will have a special responsibility for the whole union’s image in the world”. But note, Merkel is not saying anything about Hungary’s efforts to control UNSOURCED news broadcasting, spin, and just plain lying.

The law, Orban insists, is to ensure balanced reporting. “Freedom” of the press does not mean running off at the mouth without verification.

Second complaint: Hungary is targeting new taxes at foreign companies. This is not illegal. In fact, it may help to promote Hungarian jobs for Hungarian workers.

So the EU is investigating the so-called “crisis tax” that Hungary levied in October on three specific sectors

-   telecommunications,

-   energy and

-   retail.

Why the tax?
============

For 3 years TO MEET BUDGET DEFICIT TAXES. i.e. It has chosen to tax foreign companies vs. the little Hungarian taxpayer. Hmmmm...What’s wrong with that?

EU spokesman Olivier Bailly: “If this law makes a distinction between national or foreign companies, or companies based inside or outside of Hungary, this will be seen as discrimination against EU law.” Really, which one, and why didn’t Bailly quote it?

The comments follow a formal letter of complaint from these 13 Hungarian companies operating in Hungary. The letter was sent to EU commissioners and the national leaders of Germany, France, Austria, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic.

Who specifically were the senders?
==================================

-   Aegon

-   Allianz SE

-   Austrian home improvement

-   Czech energy firm CEZ

-   German utilities

Well, you get the idea: FOREIGN COMPANIES. Why shouldn’t foreign countries have to pay a taxes for the privilege of operaating in Hungary, or France, or the UK? Anyway, these measures are scheduled to end in 2013.

You know Bailley’s biggest complaint?

Bailly: “We were not informed of this new legislation before the adoption of the law. That could be a possible breach...it seems very clear that there is a violation.” Bailly said the EU Commission sent a letter to the Hungarian authorities Oct. 22 requesting more information on the taxes.

Hungary responded Dec 20, saying its national law fully complies with EU rules. A pretty dumb thing to put in writing if it’s not true!

The timing of the complaint from the 13 firms coincides with the 2010 date for tax implementation; so the 13 businesses are likely trying to evade the taxation, or push off payment.

Hungary has

-   levied extra taxes on the FINANCIAL SECTOR,

-   levied hefty taxes on energy to meet its budget-deficit targets and get out of the European Union’s EXCESSIVE DEFICIT PROCEDURE.

-   limited the powers of the Constitutional Court on tax matters so that affected companies can’t appeal the steps, and

-   effectively nationalized its private pension funds to generate additional budget revenues.

Is Hungary fit?
===============

A lot fitter than some countries in the EU who seem to lack the imagination or the courage to tackle problems in new ways.

The charges come as Hungary assumes the role of rotating president of the European Council from January through June of this year. It’s not unprecedented for the rotating president to be the target of infringement proceedings: France had several cases during its term. Bailly: “We hope the Hungarian presidency will cooperate with us even more because it holds the presidency...and has to set an example.”

Just because Hungary is electing to use different options to reduce its deficits does not mean that these options are illegal or improper.

The tax issue is not even formally on the EU agenda. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban will likely discuss (or not) the matter to coordinate responses to the press.
